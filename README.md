# National Parks
An application that allows users to currently search National Parks by state code.  There are more versions and functionality to come.  I would love to incorporate a hiking trail API in conjunction with the National Park API. Thank you to the information provided by the National Park Service API!

### User Story
The user will be able to go to a home page that allows them to enter a state code of National Parks they would like to visit.  From the home page they are directed to the index page where a list of National Parks near the zip code are populated.  The user can then click on a specific National Park to view its specific show page, and add it to their "Favorite Parks Page".  Once on the show page the user will be able to post a comment related to the National Park and delete a comment. There is also a "Visit counter" that will allow a user to increment visits relative to their amoun of visits.
